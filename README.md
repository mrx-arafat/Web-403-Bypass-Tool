## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mrx-arafat/Web-403-Bypass-dos2unix.git
cd Web-403-Bypass-dos2unix

# Install dependencies
pip3 install aiohttp

# Make executable
chmod +x bypass403.py
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Test single path
python3 bypass403.py https://target.com

# Test specific path
python3 bypass403.py https://target.com -p /admin

# Test with wordlist
python3 bypass403.py https://target.com -p wordlist.txt

# High-performance scan
python3 bypass403.py https://target.com -p wordlist.txt -t 50

# Generate detailed report
python3 bypass403.py https://target.com -p wordlist.txt -o report.json -v
```

## 📊 Advanced Usage

### Performance Tuning
```bash
# Fast scan (50 threads, minimal delay)
python3 bypass403.py https://target.com -t 50 --delay 0.05

# Conservative scan (respect rate limits)
python3 bypass403.py https://target.com -t 5 --delay 1.0

# Custom timeout
python3 bypass403.py https://target.com --timeout 30
```

### Output Options
```bash
# Verbose output
python3 bypass403.py https://target.com -v

# Save results to file
python3 bypass403.py https://target.com -o results.json

# Custom wordlist
python3 bypass403.py https://target.com -p custom-paths.txt
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Success Detection
The tool uses intelligent success detection based on:
- **HTTP Status Codes**: 200, 201, 202, 204 (success)
- **Redirects**: 301, 302, 307, 308 with content
- **Response Size**: Large responses (>1000 bytes) may indicate success
- **Content Analysis**: Excludes common error pages

### Rate Limiting
- Configurable delay between requests
- Semaphore-based concurrency control
- Respectful of target server resources

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of network errors
- Timeout management
- Connection pooling for efficiency

## 🎯 Use Cases
